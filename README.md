# piopencv
Simple C++ program to display video through OpenCV on Raspberry Pi. This is the starting point for an Augment Reality platform, so expect more functionality in this project going forward.

Reqires OpenCV v2 library and RaspiCam (https://github.com/cedricve/raspicam)

If these are installed, to build run:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

This should generate a picam executable in the build directory that can be run to show this simple program.
